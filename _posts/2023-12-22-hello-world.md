ok i'll stop

Well, it's here. It's finally here! My very own website/blog. For the past little while now I've been using Obsidian to write personal daily notes, but sometimes I wish the whole world was able to read what I was saying. Soooooo here we are! :D

I might also start a podcast or something and make it basically an audio version of this blog. Or maybe I can just have audio posts on my blog? But what if people wanted to listen to me ramble on something like Spotify? Maybe I can do both?? I don't know, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

Oh also, HUGE shoutout to [my partner](https://edamame-v.github.io) for their help with getting all this working and stuff.

...OH! WAIT! I can also use this website to post updates and stuff on this cool project I'm working on! Oh, that's gonna be so cool!

Well, I might make another post later on, but I gotta actually push this website to GitHub Pages!
