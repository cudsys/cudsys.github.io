how do i stop the urge?<br>
this feeling from within that i need to purge<br>
a surge originating from my libido<br>
an everlasting curse<br>
it's an ache that hurts and coerces<br>
always stings before it burns<br>
makes my mind lose focus as my stomach churns<br>
<br>
it's hard to explain but i have many an example<br>
too many for one poem but i'll give you a sample<br>
i could be working with a friend and within all the bustle<br>
im randomly reminded of her fucking side-hustle<br>
<br>
in exhibit b, i flee from home to a couple's sanctuary<br>
i wish i knew what i was doing, i wish that i was wary<br>
if i didn't want to feel this urge, feeling super needy<br>
then i should've waited for after dinner and not be so fucking greedy<br>
<br>
<br>
how do i stop the thoughts?<br>
many in flavour, all painful, major<br>
in fact i'd wager all the fruits of my labour<br>
that a trip or two could make my thoughts safer<br>
could kill me, you never know<br>
this brain of mine's missing a piece though<br>
<br>
much like the missing tissue on my chest<br>
or the fact that i have a...well, you know the rest<br>
these errors feed the thoughts, mirrors give me a fright<br>
all the perfect catalyst for our old friend: the blight<br>
